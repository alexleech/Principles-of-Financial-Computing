Write a program to calculate the modified duration and convexity of a cash flow.
All numbers are period based for simplicity. 
The settlement time can fall on any time between two cash flows as on p. 71 of the slides. 

Inputs: (1) s (spot rates)
	(2) C (cash flow)
	(3) w (as defined in slides). 
Output: (1) modified duration
	(2) convexity.

For example, assume 
	s = [0.053, 0.051, 0.049, 0.047]
	C = [3, 2, 3, 102]	
	w = 0.3.
Then 
	the modified duration is 2.9981
	convexity is 12.1813

Please send your 
1. source code
2. executable code
3. a brief explanation file if necessary (e.g., how to run it?) using the CEIBA system (922 U0270) before 08:00 AM of March 23, 2016. No late submissions will be accepted. Compress your files into a single file and name it StudentID_HW_1 for easy reference. Example: R91922054_HW_1. Even if you need to make an appointment with xxx for demonstration because of the unusual software you use, you still have to submit the files before the deadline.
