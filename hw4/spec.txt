Write a program to price an x-year American-style put option on a zero-coupon bond that
matures at year y with a par value of 1 dollar.
Use trees for the CIR model.
Inputs: 
		x (year), 
		y (year), 
		r (%) (initial short rate), 
		b (%) and 
		m (%), 
		s (%), 
		n (the number of steps during the option's life), and 
		strike price X (% of par).
For example, when 
		x = 1, 
		y = 2, 
		r = 4 (%), 
		b = 20 (%), 
		m = 4 (%), 
		s = 10 (%), 
		n = 30, and 
		X = 95 (%).
the option price is about 2.65173 (% of par).

Please send your source code, executable code, and a brief explanation file if necessary (e.g., how to run it?) 
using the CEIBA system (922 U0270) before 08:00 AM of June 22, 2016. 
Compress your files into a single file and name it StudentID_HW_4 for easy reference. 
Example: R91723054_HW_4. Even if you need to make an appointment with 盧政良 for demonstration because of the unusual software you use, 
you still have to submit the files before the deadline.
No late submissions will be accepted. Compress your files into a single file and name it StudentID_HW_3 for easy reference. Example: R03922054_HW_3.
